**lab1**

Formulation of the problem
1. Develop a program that will work in windowed mode and implement the given methods for solving nonlinear equations. The developed program should display all intermediate results.
2. With the help of the developed program according to claim 1, solve the given equations on the given interval with the accuracy ε ≤ 10 ^ (- 7).
3. When performing the task according to item 2, it is necessary to plot the dependence of the approximate value of the root of the equation on the number of iterations starting from the initial approximation. If the equation has more than two roots, then plot for any two roots.
Methods:
